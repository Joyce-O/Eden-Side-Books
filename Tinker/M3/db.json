          "bio": "<p>Ron Lichty has been managing and, more recently, consulting in managing software development and product organizations for over 25 years. Before that, as a programmer, he coded compiler code generators, was awarded patents for compression and security algorithms he designed and coded for embedded microcontroller devices, wrote two widely used programming texts, and developed the computer animation demo that Apple used to launch and sell a next-generation line of PCs. The primary focus of his consulting practice has mirrored what he did as a manager: untangling the knots in software development. As <a href=\"http://www.ronlichty.com\"target=_blank>Ron Lichty Consulting</a>, he takes on fractional Interim VP Engineering and Acting CTO roles, trains teams in scrum, transitions teams to agile, trains managers in managing software people and teams, and advises organizations and coaches teams to make their software development “hum.” His 450-page book, <a href=\"http://www.ManagingTheUnmanageable.net\"target=_blank><I>Managing the Unmanageable: Rules, Tools, and Insights for Managing Software People and Teams</I></a>, was recently released as video training - <a href=\" http://www.ManagingTheUnmanageable.net/video.html\"target=_blank><I>LiveLessons: Managing Software People and Teams</I></a> - both from Pearson and on O’Reilly’s Safari Network. He also co-authors the biannual <a href=\" http://www.ronlichty.com/study.html\"target=_blank><I>Study of Product Team Performance</I></a>.</p>",
